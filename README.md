Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for detecting and analyzing hate speech in textual data. The notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning model implementation to classify text as hate speech or non-hate speech.

Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Machine learning model training and evaluation

Performance metrics and insights

Requirements

To run the Jupyter Notebook, install the following dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk

Usage

Open the notebook using Jupyter:

jupyter notebook Hatespeechdatacode.ipynb

Run the cells sequentially to execute the data processing and model training steps.

Modify parameters as needed to experiment with different models and techniques.

Dataset

Ensure that the required dataset is available in the expected format before running the notebook. Update the file paths accordingly.
